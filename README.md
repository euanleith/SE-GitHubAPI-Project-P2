# SE-GitHubAPI-Project-P2

The goal of this project is to query the GitHub API to aid in answering the question 'how do hard-workers spend their time?'.

The degree of work will be calculated as the number of actions (commits, issues resolved, and pull requests) each user performs for each repo.
These values can be processed together to determine their relative weights.

This process can be extended with greater specificity of the group of actions. For example, 'commits' can be split into 'new code' and 'rewritten code' (i.e. code churn).
